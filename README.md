**Your personalized language learning assistant — built around the words you want to learn.**

The core feature of this app is that you choose the words you want to study and add them yourself. The entire learning experience is based on repetition. You can review your word list at any time, and once you’ve mastered a word, you can simply remove it and continue practicing the rest.
